# Integer Overflow Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow bug in a simple Julia function. The function `myfunction` calculates the square of a number.  However, if the input is a sufficiently large integer, the result may overflow, leading to incorrect results.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a solution to mitigate this issue.

This example highlights the importance of considering potential integer overflow issues when working with large numbers in any programming language.
